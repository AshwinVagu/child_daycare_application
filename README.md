1. **Install NPM Modules:**
   Before starting the program, make sure to install the required NPM modules. This step ensures that all required Node.js modules are installed. You'll need to navigate to your project directory in the terminal and run npm install to install these modules.
   
   npm install

2. **Start the Program:**
   To run the program, use the following command. This command will initiate the Expo development server, which will serve your React Native application.

   npm start
   
3. **Expo App Installation:**
   Install the Expo app on your mobile device. You can find it on the Google Play Store for Android or the Apple Store for iOS. This app allows you to run and test your React Native applications directly on your device.


4. **Scan QR Code:**
   After running the program using `npm start`, a QR code will be generated in the terminal. Open the Expo app on your mobile device and scan the QR code using the app's scanner. This will load your React Native application on your device.

5. **Check Mobile App Updates:**
   Once the QR code is scanned, you'll be able to see and interact with your mobile app. Any updates you make to your code will be automatically reflected in the running app, allowing for easy testing and iteration.
